<h1>Ben</h1>

<p>Ben comes from a loving family of four with one older brother, gabe who is also a friend of mine, and his very kind and funny parents who have always treated me very well and are amazing people.  Ben and I met in the 8th grade during Gardiner days because our girlfriends at the time were friends, starting a whole new friendship that hopefully will last a lifetime.    </p>
